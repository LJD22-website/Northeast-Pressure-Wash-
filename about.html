    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      At Northeast Pressure Wash & Lawn, we believe every property deserves to shine. Our business started with a simple goal: to help homeowners and businesses in Okanogan County keep their outdoor spaces clean, healthy, and welcoming. We are a small business located in Tonasket, WA serving Okanogan County. With years of experience in both lawn care and pressure washing, we combine attention to detail to deliver results that last.

    <p>
      We understand that a clean driveway or a freshly cut lawn does more than improve curb appeal‚Äîit creates a space you can enjoy and be proud of. Our team works hard to provide dependable service, affordable pricing, and friendly communication with every project. Whether it's restoring the look of concrete or maintaining a lush, green yard, our mission is to leave your property better than we found it.
